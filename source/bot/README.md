# Project Setup Guide for the Discord Bot

This guide walks you through setting up and configuring the Discord bot.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed/prepared:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.9.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A [Discord account](https://discord.com/)
- A Discord server where you have permission to add bots

## 1. Install Node.js

- **Windows**  
  Download the Windows installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the setup wizard.

- **macOS**  
  Either:  
  1. Download and run the macOS installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), _or_  
  2. Use Homebrew:

     ```sh
     brew install node
     ```

- **Linux**  
  Use your distribution’s package manager, or check the official [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for distro-specific instructions.

## 2. Prepare Your Project Folder

1. Open the folder containing  your bot.

2. Open your terminal in the project folder.

3. Confirm Node.js is installed:

   ```sh
   node -v
   ```

   You should see a version (preferably v16 or higher).

---

## 3. Initialize the Project

```sh
npm init
```



This creates a `package.json` file to track your project’s dependencies.

---

## 4. Install discord.js

Install `discord.js` :

```sh
npm install discord.js

```
---
## 5. Setting Up a Bot Application (via Discord Developer Portal)

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application"
3. Name your application and click Create
4. From the left-hand menu, go to "Bot"
5. Click "Add Bot" and confirm when prompted
6. Enable these Privileged Gateway Intents:
   - MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT (if your bot reads message content)
   - SERVER MEMBERS INTENT (if your bot interacts with member data)
   - PRESENCE INTENT (if your bot tracks member presence)

#### Note: If you plan to publish or verify your bot, only enable intents that are truly necessary.

---

## 6. Add Your Bot to a Server
1. In the Developer Portal, go to "OAuth2 > URL Generator"
2. Under Scopes, check:
   - `bot`
3. Under Bot Permissions, select the permissions your bot needs, for example:
   - Send Messages
   - Read Message History
   - View Channels
4. Copy the generated URL at the bottom
5. Paste it into your browser and select a server you manage to invite the bot

#### Note: You must have Manage Server permission in the chosen server to add bots.
---
## 7. Edit the config.json file with your bot's specifics
1. Open up the config.json file
2. Add the token, clientID, and guildID found within your bot's Developer Portal to the file
3. Add the apiBaseUrl, apiKey, and playtestSessionID generated by the solution's backend to the file
---

## 8. Run the bot
Now that we've configured the bot, run it by first deploying the commands:
```sh
   node deploy-commands.js
   ```
And finally run the bot:
```sh
   node index.js
   ```
